For each branches of your repositories, you can download the Source Code, and
once downloaded you can analyze it. Analyze in this module is basic. (For the
time being, it just gives branches sizes). But you can develop an extra Odoo
Custom module to extend analyze function and get extra stats, depending of your
needs.
